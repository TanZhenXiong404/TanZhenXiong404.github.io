BluSnarfing is 3D cubic game where the player plays as black hat who's job is to find targets from jobs just like a hitman would. Instead of killing the person, the player will have to find the target within crowds of people and maintain a distance and line of sight while using his own device lock on to the target's device. 

Once the user's device has locked on to the target's, the player will enter into the target's internal security and defeat the defending firewall and security units. Once all the security is taken care of, the player will go on to get new targets. As the player get more target, further suspected targets are more weary and hit themselves in crowd and have better security for their devices. W,A,S,D move Arrow Keys, direction of fire
